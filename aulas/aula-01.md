# O que são sistemas embarcados?

built-into - Embedded Computing System

## Characteristics

1. Microcontroller based system
	- consisting of a processor, non-volatile memory (flash), volatile memory (RAM) and a large number of inputs and output interfaces as well as communication channels
2. Cost effective implementations (must be cheap) as many device archs are cost-driven
3. Energy efficient solutions
	- many of devices are battery-powered
4. Heterogeneous (large variety of hardware and software)
5. Restrictions to the design solutions
	- size, weight, water, dust resistant
	- computational resources
	- response time
6. Interconnected (specially with IOT)
7. Reliability
8. Availability
9. Maintainability
10. testability
11. escalabilidade
12. safety
13. security
